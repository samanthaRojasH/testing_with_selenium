This is my first automation project with Selenium that I've achieved to develop with the knowledge of [Platzi](https://platzi.com/ "Platzi") and another knowledge sources, like [seleniumacademy](https://www.seleniumacademy.net/ "seleniumacademy") and internet sources. It is developed with python. This project is developed with the goal to show the practice of all adquired knowledge.
